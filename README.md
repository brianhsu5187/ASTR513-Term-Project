# ASTR513-Term-Project

Here, you can find the codes that I used for my term final project for the course ASTR513: Computational and Statistical Methods for Astrophysics at the University of Arizona. In this project, I attempted to replicate the anomaly detection algorithm presented in Villar et al. (2021), which utilizes a variational recurrent autoencoder neural network (VRAENN) to encode light curves of astrophysical transient phenomenon and an isolation forest to calculate anomaly scores using the encoded features returned by VRAENN. The Python scripts are pretty much all there is to the project, and the Jupyter notebooks are used to modify the codes from https://github.com/villrv/vraenn. The data files are too large to upload to GitHub, so please email me if you want to see them. Alternatively, you can find the PLAsTiCC data set here: https://zenodo.org/records/2539456.
